- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @debas3r.
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a university lecturer (assistant professor) of experimental psychology, and my research focuses mainly on sexual orientation, sexual arousal, and gender nonconformity. My research employs a wide range of physiological, observer-rated and self-reported variables. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested primarily in data analysis and visualisation for the purposes of research, but I am also interested in general software development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and R, specifically with a view to processing and analysing data and performing statistical analyses, as well as visualising data sets and analyses.
- ðŸ“« I can be reached via github.
