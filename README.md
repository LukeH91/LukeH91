- 👋 Hi, I’m @debas3r
- 👀 I’m interested primarily in data analysis, but I am also interested in general software development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R, specifically with a view to processing and analysing data and performing statistical analysis, as well as visualising data sets.
- 💞️ I’m a university lecturer (assistant professor) of experimental psychology, and my research focuses mainly on sexual orientation, sexual arousal, and gender nonconformity.
- 📫 I can be reached via github.
